I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). I hold a B.Eng. and an M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [UESTC](https://www.smee.uestc.edu.cn/) and [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research focuses on data-efficient generative modeling (diffusion), segmentation-guided learning, and representation learning that tightly couples images, masks, and geometry. Looking ahead, I aim to integrate geometry- and graphics-aware AI with robotic visual perception and control, and to leverage large language models to program and coordinate wearable devices and robots—toward reliable, uncertainty-aware, end-to-end systems that bridge medical imaging and embodied intelligence.
